# Trixel Tagger

Trixel tagger is an in development project related to http://trixel.io/.
It uses React and Redux on the front end, and a quick and dirty server
written in Go with Bolt for the back end. I'm primarily using it to
evaluate Redux. Trixel tagger is... maybe a third done. â€” @sethwklein
